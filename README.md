# Fraud Detection SQL Analysis: Identifying Trends in Financial Transactions

## 📌 Project Overview
Data has the power to uncover hidden patterns, especially in financial transactions. With the increasing number of digital transactions, fraud detection has become a crucial challenge for financial institutions. In this project, I applied SQL to analyze a large-scale transaction dataset containing over **6.3 million records**, identifying fraudulent patterns and extracting key insights that can help prevent financial fraud.

## 🔍 Project Motivation: Why Fraud Detection Matters?
Fraudulent transactions cost businesses **billions of dollars annually**, making fraud detection a top priority for financial security. The goal of this project was to explore how **SQL analytics** can be applied to transaction data to:
- Identify **suspicious activity**
- Detect **high-risk accounts**
- Recognize **transaction anomalies**

By leveraging **SQL techniques**, this project provides valuable insights into fraud detection and highlights strategies for enhancing financial security.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
- **Source:** [Fraud Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
- **Total Transactions:** 6.3 million
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** 8,000 (highly imbalanced dataset)
-

## 🛠 SQL Techniques Used
- **CTEs & Subqueries**: Simplify complex queries and improve readability
- **JOINs**: Analyze relationships between transactions
- **CASE Statements**: Classify transactions based on risk levels
- **Aggregations & Grouping**: Detect suspicious behaviors
- **Window Functions**: Compare transaction values over time

## 🔎 Key Insights from SQL Analysis

### 1️⃣ Identifying the Most Frequent Fraudulent Origin Accounts
Fraudulent activities are often linked to specific accounts that engage in multiple suspicious transactions. Identifying these **high-risk accounts** can help financial institutions take preventive actions.

**Finding:**
> Surprisingly, no single origin account committed fraud **more than once** in this dataset. Each fraudulent transaction came from a **unique origin account**, suggesting that fraudsters may be using one-time-use accounts or stolen identities to evade detection.

### 2️⃣ High-Value Fraudulent Transaction Types
Some types of transactions are more commonly used in fraud.

**Finding:**
> **TRANSFER transactions** have the highest number (**72,254**) of high-value fraudulent transactions. This suggests that fraudsters prefer transfers for committing fraud, likely because it allows them to **move large amounts quickly**.

### 3️⃣ Time-Based Fraud Analysis
Fraudulent transactions often occur at specific times when monitoring is minimal.

**Finding:**
> Fraud is most common at **5 AM, 2 PM, and 10 PM**. Additionally, **late-night and early-morning** transactions show **increased fraudulent activity**, suggesting that fraudsters exploit times when financial monitoring is lower.

## 📈 Conclusion
This SQL analysis provided valuable insights into **fraudulent transaction patterns, high-risk accounts, and time-based fraud trends**. Identifying repeat offenders and high-value fraudulent transactions helps strengthen fraud detection mechanisms, while recognizing peak fraud hours emphasizes the need for **real-time monitoring**. 

From a personal standpoint, this project deepened my understanding of **data-driven fraud detection** and the role of SQL in financial security. Uncovering these fraud patterns highlights vulnerabilities in digital transactions and demonstrates how **data analytics can help mitigate risks**.
